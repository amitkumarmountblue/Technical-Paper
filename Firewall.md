## **What is Firewall ?**

A firewall is a security tool - computer hardware or software - that monitors and control incoming and outgoing and incoming traffic based on predefined goals. It acts as a barrier between your internal network and the outside networks.However, it is also necessary to protect each computer with a software firewall so that if one computer is infected the other computer will be free of the infections and should possesses the following properties :
* Every road from inside to outside, and vice versa, you must pass through.
* Only authorized traffic, as defined by the local safety policy, is permitted to pass through.
* The firewall itself cannot be accessed.

## **Why do we need Firewall ?**

Computers, laptops and other devices that are connected to the internet are vulnerable and potential target of a range of different threats such as hackers and viruses etc. that enters through untreated security portals. This can make you a victim of identity theft or other attacks. So, firewall protects you as it acts as a barrier between your computer and the dangers of the cyber world.

## **How Firewall works ?**

When your computer has firewall protection, everything that goes in and out of it is monitored. Then firewall monitors all this information traffic to allow good data in and block bad data entering your computer.

Firewall use one or a combination of thefollowing three methods to control traffic flowing in and out of he netwwork.

## **Types of Firewall**
 ### 1. Packet Filtering Firewall 

     Packet Filtering Firewall controls the network access by analyzing the outgoing and incoming packets. It lets a packet pass or block its way by comparing it with pre-established criteria like allowed IP addresses, packet type, port number, etc. Packet filtering technique is suitable for small networks but gets complex when implemented to larger networks

### 2.  Application/Proxy Firewall

     A Application/Proxy firewall is a program that can help protect your network security by filtering messages in the application layer. It acts as a gateway or middle man between your internal network and external servers on the web. Also known as the gateway firewall, it is extremely safe in stateful and in-depth packet inspection technology to analyze incoming traffic.

### 3. Hybrid Firewall

     A hybrid firewall may have a packet filter attached to the application proxy firewall, or a circuit gateway connected to the application proxy firewall. A firewall is usually the first line of defense against cyber attacks. Unlike other firewalls, however, Network Box uses the Hybrid Firewall to effectively protect your servers and operating systems from malicious probes and unauthorized access.

## **Conclusions**

   Without the limitation of firewall and the fact that they are not panaceas for all aspects of network security,nor the sole sufficient bulwark against network intrusion, and despite the alarming development trends, powerful protective mechanism, and will continue to play an important and critical role in maintaining network security for some years now, and any organisation that ignores them does so at its peril.
   They are constantly changing and evolving, and new features are being added whenever needed. If the development follows the current trend, they will continue to integrate manageable control and verification methods with their traditional functions, thus providing strong and flexible protection for networks to make them safer.
